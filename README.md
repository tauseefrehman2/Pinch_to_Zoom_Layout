# Pinch to Zoom Linear Layout With ScrollView
In this project, i'm going to implement zoom on ScrollView. Most of the time when we create a scroll view then
it contains a lot of data and if we want to view any content on zooming then we can implement this feature.
This feature can be useful when we are scroll in an App and that contains data using RecyclerView or viewGroups.
Note that we are going to implement this project using the Java language. 

Sample Images are attached below


Normal View
